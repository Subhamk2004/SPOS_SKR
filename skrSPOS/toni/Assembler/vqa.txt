I'll break down the theory, explanation, and provide viva questions for this Assembly Language Pass 1 code.

Theory:
This is an implementation of Pass 1 of a two-pass assembler. The main purposes of Pass 1 are:
1. Generate intermediate code
2. Create symbol table (SYMTAB)
3. Create literal table (LITTAB)
4. Create pool table (POOLTAB)
5. Handle assembly directives
6. Process labels and assign addresses

Key Components:
1. Symbol Table: Stores program symbols and their attributes (address, index)
2. Literal Table: Stores literals used in the program
3. Pool Table: Manages literal pools
4. Location Counter (LC): Keeps track of memory addresses
5. Intermediate Code: Generated code for Pass 2

Important Data Structures Used:
- LinkedHashMap for SYMTAB
- ArrayList for LITTAB and POOLTAB
- BufferedReader/BufferedWriter for file operations

Explanation of Key Methods:
1. parseFile(): Main method that:
   - Processes input assembly code line by line
   - Handles labels, opcodes, and operands
   - Generates intermediate code
   - Updates tables accordingly

2. expr(): Evaluates expressions involving symbols
3. printIC(), printSYMTAB(), PrintLITTAB(), printPOOLTAB(): Output generation methods

Viva Questions and Answers:

Q1: What is the purpose of Pass 1 in assembly language processing?
A1: Pass 1's main purposes are:
- Define symbols and assign addresses
- Generate intermediate code
- Create symbol table, literal table, and pool table
- Process assembly directives
- Maintain location counter

Q2: Explain the data structures used in this implementation.
A2: The code uses:
- LinkedHashMap for SYMTAB to maintain symbol order and provide quick lookups
- ArrayList for LITTAB to store literals sequentially
- ArrayList for POOLTAB to manage literal pools
- These provide efficient storage and retrieval of assembly program elements

Q3: How does the location counter (lc) work in this implementation?
A3: The location counter:
- Starts from 0 or value specified by START
- Increments based on instruction size
- Adjusts for DS/DC declarations
- Can be modified by ORIGIN directive
- Tracks memory addresses for symbols and instructions

Q4: What is the purpose of the LTORG directive handling in the code?
A4: LTORG handling:
- Forces literal pool dumping
- Updates POOLTAB with new literal pool
- Assigns addresses to literals
- Generates intermediate code for literals
- Resets literal pool pointer

Q5: How are forward references handled in this implementation?
A5: Forward references are handled by:
- Initially storing symbols with address -1
- Maintaining symbol table indices
- Updating addresses when symbols are defined
- Using symbol table index in intermediate code

Q6: Explain the format of intermediate code generated.
A6: Intermediate code format:
- (Class, Code) pairs
- Classes include IS (Instructions), DL (Declarations), AD (Assembler Directives)
- Operands represented by (S,index) for symbols, (L,index) for literals
- Constants represented by (C,value)

Q7: What is the significance of POOLTAB?
A7: POOLTAB:
- Manages literal pools
- Stores starting index of each literal pool
- Updated during LTORG and END directives
- Helps in organizing literals efficiently

Q8: How does the code handle assembly directives like START, ORIGIN, and EQU?
A8: The code:
- START: Initializes location counter
- ORIGIN: Modifies location counter based on expression
- EQU: Assigns value to symbol based on expression
- Generates appropriate intermediate code for each directive

These questions and answers cover the main aspects of the Pass 1 implementation and should help in understanding the code thoroughly.
