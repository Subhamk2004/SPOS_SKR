The `Pass2asm` program is the second pass of a two-pass assembler, typically used in the assembly of machine code from intermediate code, and involves generating machine code from the intermediate representation stored in files. The code is designed to process symbol and literal tables from `SYMTAB.txt` and `LITTAB.txt` respectively, and generate machine code in `PASS2.txt` from the intermediate code in `IC.txt`.

### Key Components:
1. **SYMTAB and LITTAB:**
   - `SYMTAB` is an array list used for storing the symbol table, which maps symbols to their addresses and other attributes.
   - `LITTAB` is an array list for literal table, which stores literals and their respective addresses.

2. **Methods:**
   - **readtables():** Reads the symbol and literal tables from `SYMTAB.txt` and `LITTAB.txt`. The tables are parsed and added to `SYMTAB` and `LITTAB` as `Tables` objects.
   
   - **generateCode(String filename):** Main method that processes intermediate code from `IC.txt` and generates machine code in `PASS2.txt`. It reads the intermediate code line by line and processes the instructions based on their type:
     - It replaces register values (e.g., `(RG,01)`) with the corresponding register number (`1`, `2`, etc.).
     - It handles instruction formats, such as `IS`, `AD`, `DL`, and literal/variable replacement.
     - For `IS` (Instruction Set) type, it formats the opcode, registers, and addresses appropriately.
   
   - **printMC():** Reads and prints the generated machine code from `PASS2.txt`.

### Code Structure:
- **Initialization and File Handling:**
  The program begins by creating `SYMTAB` and `LITTAB` as empty lists and reads the necessary input files. It processes the intermediate code and generates corresponding machine code.

- **Intermediate Code Processing:**
  The intermediate code (`IC.txt`) is processed in a loop. For each line:
  - If it contains `(RG,xx)`, it is replaced with the register number.
  - For instructions like `IS`, `AD`, or `DL`, it replaces mnemonic codes with their corresponding machine code, accessing the symbol and literal tables to retrieve addresses.

- **Generating Machine Code:**
  Each instruction is translated into machine code in the format `opcode \t register \t address`. The final machine code is written to `PASS2.txt`.

- **Error Handling:**
  The program includes error handling that prints an error message when an exception occurs.

### Example of Expected Output:
Given an intermediate code file, the program generates machine code with proper replacements for symbols, literals, and registers.

```text
Machine Code:
01	00	001
02	00	002
...
```

### Suggestions for Improvement:
- **Exception Handling:** While there's some basic error handling, you could expand the try-catch blocks to handle specific exceptions like `FileNotFoundException` or `IOException` to provide more detailed error messages.
- **Input Validation:** Ensure the input file format matches the expected structure (i.e., valid instructions, correct symbol/literal format).
- **Optimization:** If the symbol/literal tables are very large, consider using more efficient data structures for faster lookups (e.g., hash maps instead of lists).
