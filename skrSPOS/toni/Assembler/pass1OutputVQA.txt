This output provides the **Intermediate Code**, **Symbol Table**, **Literal Table**, and **Pool Table** generated by the first pass of an assembler, specifically for the input assembly language program. Let’s go over each part in detail.

### Intermediate Code
The intermediate code is a structured representation of the assembly code using mnemonic codes and references. Each instruction and directive in the source program is translated into this intermediate form, which is then used in the assembler’s second pass to generate machine code.

1. **(AD,01) (C,100)**
   - **AD (Assembler Directive)**: `(AD,01)` represents `START`.
   - **(C,100)**: Constant `100`, setting the location counter to `100` (starting address).

2. **(IS,04) (RG,01) (L,0)**
   - **IS (Imperative Statement)**: `(IS,04)` represents `MOVER`, moving a value to `AREG`.
   - **(RG,01)**: Register `AREG`.
   - **(L,0)**: Refers to literal table index `0` (literal `='5'`), meaning `MOVER AREG, ='5'`.

3. **(IS,01) (RG,03) (L,1)**
   - **(IS,01)** is `ADD`, adding to `CREG`.
   - **(RG,03)**: Register `CREG`.
   - **(L,1)**: Refers to literal table index `1` (literal `='1'`).

4. **(DL,01) (C,3)**
   - **DL (Declarative Statement)**: `(DL,01)` is `DS`, defining storage.
   - **(C,3)**: Constant `3`, allocating three memory words for the label `A`.

5. **(IS,04) (RG,01) (S,03)**
   - **(IS,04)** is `MOVER`.
   - **(RG,01)**: Register `AREG`.
   - **(S,03)**: Symbol table entry `3` (label `B`).

6. **(IS,01) (RG,01) (S,04)**
   - **(IS,01)** is `ADD`.
   - **(RG,01)**: Register `AREG`.
   - **(S,04)**: Symbol table entry `4` (label `C`).

7. **(IS,05) (RG,01) (S,05)**
   - **(IS,05)** is `MOVEM`, moving contents of `AREG` to memory.
   - **(S,05)**: Symbol table entry `5` (label `D`).

8. **(IS,07) (CC,04) (S,02)**
   - **(IS,07)** is `BC` (Branch on Condition).
   - **(CC,04)**: Condition code for `LE` (Less or Equal).
   - **(S,02)**: Symbol table entry `2` (label `L1`).

9. **(DL,02) (C,5)**
   - **(DL,02)** is `DC`, defining a constant.
   - **(C,5)**: Constant `5` for label `C`.

10. **(DL,02) (C,1)**
    - `DC` statement for the constant `1`, another literal.

11. **(IS,04) (RG,01) (L,2)**
    - **(IS,04)** is `MOVER`.
    - **(RG,01)**: Register `AREG`.
    - **(L,2)**: Literal table entry `2` (`='5'`).

12. **(AD,04) (C,103)**
    - **(AD,04)** is `EQU`, equating `D` to `A + 1`.
    - **(C,103)**: Address `103` for label `D`.

13. **(IS,010) (S,05)**
    - **(IS,010)** is `PRINT`.
    - **(S,05)**: Symbol table entry `5` (label `D`).

14. **(IS,03) (RG,03) (S,03)**
    - **(IS,03)** is `MULT`.
    - **(RG,03)**: Register `CREG`.
    - **(S,03)**: Symbol table entry `3` (label `B`).

15. **(DL,02) (C,5)**
    - `DC` statement for the constant `5`.

16. **(IS,00)**
    - **(IS,00)** represents `STOP`, ending program execution.

17. **(DL,02) (C,19)**
    - **(DL,02)** represents `DC`, defining the constant `19`.

18. **(DL,02) (C,5)**
    - `DC` statement for the constant `5`.

19. **(AD,02)**
    - **AD (Assembler Directive)**: `(AD,02)` corresponds to `END`, marking the end of the program.

### Symbol Table
This table contains each **symbol (label)**, its **index**, and its **memory address**.

| Index | Symbol | Address |
|-------|--------|---------|
| 1     | A      | 102     |
| 2     | L1     | 105     |
| 3     | B      | 116     |
| 4     | C      | 114     |
| 5     | D      | 103     |
| 6     | L2     | 112     |

- Each entry represents a label from the code, with its assigned memory address.
- The address is calculated or set based on assembler directives like `START`, `ORIGIN`, and `EQU`, or by allocating space with `DS`.

---

### Literal Table
The literal table keeps track of all **literal values** and their **addresses**.

| Index | Literal | Address |
|-------|---------|---------|
| 0     | 5       | 109     |
| 1     | 1       | 110     |
| 2     | 5       | 117     |

- Each literal in the program is assigned an address in memory.
- The assembler ensures literals are placed in the correct addresses when processing assembler directives like `LTORG` and `END`.

---

### POOLTAB (Pool Table)
The **pool table** stores **starting indices** for literals that belong to each pool.

| Index | LitIndex |
|-------|----------|
| 0     | 0        |
| 1     | 2        |

- **Purpose of Pool Table**: To manage multiple literal pools, which are especially useful in programs with multiple `LTORG` directives.
- In this program, there are two pools: the first one starts at index `0` and the second at index `2` in the literal table.

---

### Summary
This output from **Pass 1** provides:
1. **Intermediate Code**: Encodes each instruction and directive with references to symbols, literals, and registers.
2. **Symbol Table**: Tracks each label’s memory address.
3. **Literal Table**: Lists literals and their assigned addresses.
4. **Pool Table**: Organizes literals in multiple pools, useful for repeated use of literals in large programs.

In **Pass 2**, the assembler will convert this intermediate code into machine code by resolving all references to symbols and literals using the tables generated here.
