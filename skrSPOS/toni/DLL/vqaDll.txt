I'll break down the theory, explain the code, and provide viva questions for this Java Native Interface (JNI) example.

Theory:
This code demonstrates Java Native Interface (JNI), which allows Java code to:
1. Call native applications/libraries written in other languages (C, C++, Assembly)
2. Be called by native applications
3. Access system-level operations not available in Java
4. Load Dynamic Link Libraries (DLL) for platform-specific functionality

Key Components:
1. Native Method Declaration
2. DLL Loading
3. JNI Implementation
4. Native Method Call

Explanation:
The code:
1. Loads a native library using System.loadLibrary()
2. Declares a native method for addition
3. Gets user input for two numbers
4. Calls the native method to perform addition
5. Displays the result

Viva Questions and Answers:

Q1: What is JNI and why is it used?
A1: JNI (Java Native Interface) is:
- A framework that enables Java code to call native code (C/C++)
- Allows access to platform-specific features
- Enables reuse of existing native libraries
- Provides system-level operations
- Helps in performance-critical operations

Q2: Explain the significance of the static block in the code.
A2: The static block:
```java
static {
    System.loadLibrary("SampleDLL");
}
```
- Loads the native library when class is loaded
- Executes before any methods are called
- Essential for making native methods available
- Throws UnsatisfiedLinkError if library not found

Q3: What is the purpose of the 'native' keyword?
A3: The 'native' keyword:
- Declares a method implemented in native code
- Indicates method body is in external library
- Links Java method to native implementation
- No method body in Java code
- Must be implemented in native language (C/C++)

Q4: How is the native method implemented in C/C++?
A4: Native method implementation:
- Created in C/C++ following JNI naming convention
- Must match Java method signature
- Example C header:
```c
JNIEXPORT jint JNICALL Java_SampleDLL_add
  (JNIEnv *, jobject, jint, jint);
```

Q5: What are the steps to create and use a JNI program?
A5: Steps are:
1. Write Java code with native method declaration
2. Compile Java code (javac)
3. Generate header file (javah)
4. Implement native method in C/C++
5. Compile native code into shared library
6. Run Java program with library in path

Q6: What are potential issues when using JNI?
A6: Potential issues:
- Platform dependency
- Security risks from native code
- Debugging complexity
- Performance overhead
- Memory management issues
- Version compatibility

Q7: How does error handling work in JNI?
A7: Error handling:
- UnsatisfiedLinkError for missing library
- Native code must handle its errors
- Java can catch exceptions from native code
- System.loadLibrary() can throw SecurityException
- Important to handle both Java and native errors

Q8: What is the difference between System.loadLibrary() and System.load()?
A8: Differences:
- loadLibrary(): Uses system library path
- load(): Requires full path to library
- loadLibrary() is platform-independent
- load() needs platform-specific path
- loadLibrary() is preferred for portability

Q9: What security considerations should be taken when using JNI?
A9: Security considerations:
- Validate all native code
- Control access to native methods
- Handle memory safely
- Check for buffer overflows
- Implement proper error handling
- Consider SecurityManager restrictions

Q10: How can you improve the performance of JNI calls?
A10: Performance improvements:
- Minimize number of JNI calls
- Batch operations when possible
- Cache JNI references
- Use direct ByteBuffers
- Optimize data transfers
- Profile native code

These questions cover the important aspects of:
- JNI basics and usage
- Native method implementation
- Security and performance
- Error handling
- Development process
- Best practices

This code demonstrates a simple but practical use of JNI for extending Java's capabilities through native code integration.
