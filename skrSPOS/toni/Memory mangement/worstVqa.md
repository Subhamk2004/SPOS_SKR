### Theory and Explanation

This program demonstrates the **Worst-Fit Memory Allocation** strategy, where each process is allocated to the largest available memory block that can accommodate its size. The goal of Worst-Fit is to leave smaller blocks free, potentially allowing better accommodation of smaller processes later. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Data Structures**:
   - `blockSize` and `processSize` are vectors that store memory block sizes and process sizes.
   - `allocation` is initialized with `-1` to indicate that no process is allocated initially.

2. **Worst-Fit Allocation Logic**:
   - For each process in `processSize`, the algorithm iterates through all memory blocks to find the largest block (`worstIdx`) that can accommodate the process.
   - If a suitable block is found (`worstIdx` is not `-1`), the process is allocated to it (`allocation[i] = worstIdx + 1` for 1-based indexing), and the size of the block is reduced by the process size.

3. **Output**:
   - Each process’s allocation status, including the memory block number (or `-1` if unallocated), is displayed.

**Worst-Fit Pros and Cons**:
   - This strategy may leave larger memory blocks more fragmented, potentially causing higher external fragmentation.
   - Worst-Fit can help smaller processes get allocated more easily since larger blocks are split, but it often leads to inefficient memory utilization.

### Viva Questions and Answers

1. **Q**: What is the Worst-Fit memory allocation strategy?
   - **A**: Worst-Fit is a memory allocation strategy that assigns each process to the largest available block that can accommodate it, leaving smaller blocks unoccupied for other processes.

2. **Q**: How does Worst-Fit handle fragmentation compared to Best-Fit?
   - **A**: Worst-Fit often increases external fragmentation because it breaks larger blocks into smaller pieces, which might make it hard to allocate large processes later.

3. **Q**: What is the purpose of initializing the `allocation` vector with `-1`?
   - **A**: It marks all processes as unallocated initially. If a process cannot be allocated to any block, it remains with `-1` in the output.

4. **Q**: What happens if there is no block large enough for a process?
   - **A**: If no block can accommodate the process, it remains unallocated, indicated by a `-1` in the `allocation` vector for that process.

5. **Q**: Why is `worstIdx` initialized with `-1` inside each process iteration?
   - **A**: Initializing `worstIdx` to `-1` helps to identify whether any suitable block has been found for the current process. If it remains `-1`, the process cannot be allocated.
