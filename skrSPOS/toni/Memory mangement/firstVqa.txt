I'll provide the theory, explanation, and viva questions for this First Fit Memory Allocation implementation.

Theory:
First Fit is a memory allocation strategy where:
- The first available memory block that is large enough to accommodate the process is allocated
- It scans memory blocks sequentially until finding a sufficient block
- Simple and fast compared to Best Fit and Worst Fit
- Can lead to external fragmentation over time

Key Concepts:
1. Sequential Search: Blocks are searched in order
2. Memory Utilization: How effectively memory is used
3. Search Speed: Time taken to find suitable blocks
4. Fragmentation: Both internal and external
5. Memory Block Management: Keeping track of available space

Code Explanation:
This implementation:
1. Uses vectors to track memory allocation
2. Takes input for:
   - Number and sizes of memory blocks
   - Number and sizes of processes
3. For each process:
   - Scans blocks sequentially
   - Allocates first sufficient block
   - Updates remaining block size
4. Displays allocation results showing:
   - Process number
   - Process size
   - Allocated block number

Viva Questions and Answers:

1. Q: What are the main advantages of First Fit over other memory allocation strategies?
   A: First Fit offers several advantages:
   - Simpler implementation
   - Faster allocation time (O(n) vs O(nÂ²) for Best Fit)
   - Less computational overhead
   - Good for systems where speed is more important than memory utilization
   - Generally performs better than Best Fit in many practical situations

2. Q: How does the break statement in the inner loop affect the algorithm's behavior?
   A: The break statement exits the inner loop as soon as a suitable block is found for a process. This implements the "first fit" strategy by ensuring that the process is allocated to the first available block that's large enough, rather than continuing to search for potentially better blocks.

3. Q: What is the significance of initializing the allocation vector with -1?
   A: The allocation vector is initialized with -1 to:
   - Indicate unallocated processes initially
   - Serve as a flag for allocation failure
   - Help distinguish between allocated processes (positive block numbers) and unallocated ones (-1)
   - Make it easy to identify processes that couldn't be allocated in the output

4. Q: What are the potential drawbacks of using First Fit allocation?
   A: First Fit has several drawbacks:
   - Can lead to higher external fragmentation compared to Best Fit
   - May not utilize memory as efficiently as Best Fit
   - Early memory blocks tend to get split into small pieces
   - Performance can degrade over time as memory becomes fragmented

5. Q: How does this implementation handle the remaining space in blocks after allocation?
   A: The implementation handles remaining space by:
   - Subtracting the process size from the block size (blockSize[j] -= processSize[i])
   - Keeping track of the reduced block size for future allocations
   - Allowing the remaining space to be used for future processes if large enough
   - The remaining space stays with the original block, potentially leading to internal fragmentation
