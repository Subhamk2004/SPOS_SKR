### **Theory**:

This Java program demonstrates **Reader-Writer synchronization** using **semaphores**. The problem being solved is one where multiple threads (representing processes) can either read from or write to a shared resource. The key rules are:

- **Multiple readers can read simultaneously**, but **only one writer can write at a time**.
- If a writer is writing, **no readers can read**, and vice versa.

The program ensures synchronization using two semaphores:
1. **`readlock`**: Used to synchronize the readers, ensuring that the count of readers is updated properly and writers do not start when there are readers.
2. **`writelock`**: Used to allow exclusive access to the resource for writers, ensuring no other writers or readers can access the resource during writing.

### **Code Explanation**:

#### 1. **Semaphore Initialization**:
   - `readlock`: Controls access to the `readcount` variable, which tracks how many readers are currently reading.
   - `writelock`: Ensures that only one writer can access the resource at a time, blocking readers during writing.

#### 2. **Read Class**:
   - The `Read` class implements the `Runnable` interface. Its `run()` method:
     - Increments the `readcount` (using `readlock` to synchronize).
     - If the first reader arrives (`readcount == 1`), it acquires the `writelock` to block writers.
     - After reading, it decrements the `readcount` and releases the `writelock` when all readers are done.

#### 3. **Write Class**:
   - The `Write` class implements the `Runnable` interface. Its `run()` method:
     - Acquires the `writelock` to ensure exclusive access to the shared resource.
     - Simulates writing by sleeping for a short time and then releasing the `writelock`.

#### 4. **`fun()` Method**:
   - The method reads user input to determine the number of read/write processes and their sequence.
   - Based on user input, it creates and starts the appropriate number of `Read` and `Write` threads.
   - It uses an array `seq[]` where `1` indicates a read operation and `0` indicates a write operation.

#### 5. **Main Method**:
   - Instantiates the `RW` class and calls the `fun()` method to start the program.

### **Code**:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.Semaphore;
import java.util.Scanner;

public class RW {
    Semaphore readlock = new Semaphore(1);
    Semaphore writelock = new Semaphore(1);

    static int readcount = 0;

    public class Read implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                readlock.acquire();
                readcount++;
                if (readcount == 1) {
                    writelock.acquire();
                }
                readlock.release();

                System.out.println("Thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is reading.");
                Thread.sleep(2500);  // Simulate reading
                System.out.println("Thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName() + " has finished reading");

                readcount--;
                readlock.acquire();
                if (readcount == 0) {
                    writelock.release();
                }
                readlock.release();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println(e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }

    public class Write implements Runnable {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            try {
                writelock.acquire();
                System.out.println("Thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is Writing.");
                Thread.sleep(1000);  // Simulate writing
                System.out.println("Thread " + Thread.currentThread().getName() + " has finished writing.");
                writelock.release();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println(e.getMessage());
            }
        }
    }

    void fun() {
        Read read = new Read();
        Write write = new Write();
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter the number of read & write processes: ");
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int seq[] = new int[n];
        System.out.println("Enter the sequence: 1 for reading & 0 for writing.");
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            seq[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }

        Thread processes[] = new Thread[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (seq[i] == 1) {
                processes[i] = new Thread(read);
                processes[i].setName("thread " + (i + 1));
            } else if (seq[i] == 0) {
                processes[i] = new Thread(write);
                processes[i].setName("thread " + (i + 1));
            }
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            processes[i].start();
        }
        sc.close();
    }

    public static void main(String args[]) {
        RW rw = new RW();
        rw.fun();
    }
}

### **Viva Questions and Answers**:

1. **Q1: What is the purpose of semaphores in this program?**
   - **Answer**: Semaphores (`readlock` and `writelock`) are used for synchronization. `readlock` is used to manage access to the `readcount` variable and ensure correct reader count management. `writelock` is used to give exclusive access to the resource for writing and prevent readers from accessing the resource while a writer is writing.

2. **Q2: How does the program handle multiple readers and writers?**
   - **Answer**: The program allows multiple readers to read simultaneously, as long as no writer is writing. It uses the `readlock` to synchronize readers and `writelock` to ensure only one writer accesses the resource at a time. Writers block readers from reading while they are writing.

3. **Q3: What is the role of the `readcount` variable?**
   - **Answer**: The `readcount` variable tracks the number of readers currently accessing the resource. It ensures that when the first reader arrives, a writer is blocked (`writelock.acquire()`), and when the last reader finishes, the writer can write again (`writelock.release()`).

4. **Q4: What happens if a writer tries to write when readers are reading?**
   - **Answer**: If a writer tries to write while readers are reading, the writer is blocked because `writelock` is acquired by the readers when they start reading, preventing the writer from accessing the resource.

5. **Q5: How does the program ensure that threads are executed in the correct order?**
   - **Answer**: The program takes input from the user about the sequence of read and write processes. Based on this input, it starts threads for reading and writing in the specified sequence. Each thread runs independently, but semaphores ensure that the synchronization constraints are met.
